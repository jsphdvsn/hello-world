# hello-world
shortest desc. possible? 
so this is the firtst time i've used github, obviously? 
I would like to learn a little bit more about the world of programming so that I may make positive changes for humanity. the world can be pretty messed-up, no? Well, perhaps some changes can be made to affect us in a positive manner and I hope to take part in some of those changes.
